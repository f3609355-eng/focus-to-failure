GitHub Pages setup (repo root hosting)

1) Upload ALL files in this folder to the ROOT of your GitHub repo.
   (index.html must be at the top level.)

2) Repo Settings -> Pages:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main
   - Folder: / (root)

3) Wait for the Pages URL.

If buttons don't work:
- Make sure you're opening the hosted URL (https://...), not the file directly via file://
- Ensure app.js is in the same directory as index.html (this package is already correct).
